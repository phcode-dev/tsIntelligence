This document outlines how documentation is handled in this repo.

## The `docs` folder
The `docs` folder in this repo is the main code/API/Extension
docs folder for phoenix. We can autogenerate
most of the GitHub Wiki from the contents of this folder.

### Docs Folder Structure
There are two main components to the docs folder:

1. The contents of the `docs` folder are automatically pushed into gitHub wiki
   as a sub folder `generatedDocs`. Make changes to Markdown files in this folder
   to update wiki entries.
2. The docs in the `docs/generatedApiDocs` are autoGenerated API docs from source. These
   `markdown` docs should never be manually edited as their contents will be reset when autogenerated
   and all manually made changes will be lost.

## How To Write API docs
This section covers how API docs are auto generated nad how you can update API docs.

To Include any `.js` file containing [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) in Phoenix API docs,
have this comment in any part of the file:
```js
// @INCLUDE_IN_API_DOCS 
```

### Writing JSDoc in source
Let us consider this example source file [src/utils/Metrics.js](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/blob/main/src/utils/Metrics.js).
The file is created with [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) compliant source code comments. Make changes to
the source code comments as required.

When you run `npm run createJSDocs` or `npm run build` the corresponding docs for the js file are automatically generated at [docs/generatedApiDocs/utils/Metrics-API.md](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/blob/main/docs/generatedApiDocs/utils/Metrics-API.md).

The generated docs should be pushed to phoenix repo if there are any doc changes.
Once the changes are pushed, the build system will update the docs in all
[wikis](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/wiki)/
[doc](https://docs.phcode.dev/) sites automatically.

## JSDoc Examples

### Declaring a Module with `@module` tag

This document outlines how documentation is handled in phoenix.

## The `docs` folder
The `docs` folder in Phoenix repo is the main code/API/Extension
docs folder for phoenix. Most of the Phoenix GitHub Wiki is
autogenerated from the contents of this folder.

### Docs Folder Structure
There are two main components to the docs folder:

1. The contents of the `docs` folder are automatically pushed into gitHub wiki
   as a sub folder `generatedDocs`. Make changes to Markdown files in this folder
   to update wiki entries.
2. The docs in the `docs/generatedApiDocs` are autoGenerated API docs from source. These
   `markdown` docs should never be manually edited as their contents will be reset when autogenerated
   and all manually made changes will be lost.

## How To Write API docs
This section covers how API docs are auto generated nad how you can update API docs.

To Include any `.js` file containing [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) in Phoenix API docs,
have this comment in any part of the file:
```js
// @INCLUDE_IN_API_DOCS 
```

### Writing JSDoc in source
Let us consider this example source file [src/utils/Metrics.js](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/blob/main/src/utils/Metrics.js).
The file is created with [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) compliant source code comments. Make changes to
the source code comments as required.

When you run `npm run createJSDocs` or `npm run build` the corresponding docs for the js file are automatically generated at [docs/generatedApiDocs/utils/Metrics-API.md](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/blob/main/docs/generatedApiDocs/utils/Metrics-API.md).

The generated docs should be pushed to phoenix repo if there are any doc changes.
Once the changes are pushed, the build system will update the docs in all
[wikis](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/wiki)/
[doc](https://docs.phcode.dev/) sites automatically.

## JSDoc Examples
This section outlines the various tags available in JSDoc to style docs with examples.

note: All comment blocks wit `@private` tag will be ignored and won't appear in the docs.

### 1. Declaring a Module with `@module` tag

Use this to declare top level JS modules

```js
/**
 * The Metrics API can be used to send analytics data to track feature usage in accordance with users privacy settings.
 *
 *`Status: Internal - Not to be used by third party extensions.`
 *
 * ### Import
 * ```
* // usage within core:
* const Metrics = require("utils/Metrics");
*
* // usage within default extensions:
* const Metrics = brackets.getModule("utils/Metrics");
* ```
*
* @module utils/Metrics
  */
```

Will Result in the following Markdown
> ## utils/Metrics
> The Metrics API can be used to send analytics data to track feature usage in accordance with users privacy settings.
>`Status: Internal - Not to be used by third party extensions.`
>### Import
>```js
>// usage within core:
>const Metrics = require("utils/Metrics");
>// usage within default extensions:
>const Metrics = brackets.getModule("utils/Metrics");
>```

### 2. Putting custom section in Markdown using `@name` tag

Use this to put custom markdown anywhere in the doc file.

```js
/**
 * This section outlines the properties and methods available in this module
 * @name API
 */
```

Will Result in the following Markdown
> ## API
>This section outlines the properties and methods available in this module

### 3. types/constants using `@type` or `const`

Use this to put constants or type definitions

```js
/**
 * The max audit entries, default is 3000
 * @const {number}
 */
const MAX_AUDIT_ENTRIES = 3000;
```

Will Result in the following Markdown
> ## MAX_AUDIT_ENTRIES
>
>The max audit entries, default is 3000
>
>Type: [number]()


### 4. Objects using `@typedef` and `@type`

Use this to doccment Objects

#### Metrhord 1

```js
/**
 * The Type of events that can be specified as an `eventType` in the API calls.
 *
 * ### Properties
 * `PLATFORM`, `PROJECT`, `THEMES`
 *
 * @typedef EVENT_TYPE
 * @type {Object}
 */
const EVENT_TYPE = {
    PLATFORM: "platform",
    PROJECT: "project",
    THEMES: "themes"
};
```

Will Result in the following Markdown
> ## EVENT_TYPE
> The Type of events that can be specified as an `eventType` in the API calls.
>### Properties
>`PLATFORM`, `PROJECT`, `THEMES`
>
> Type: [Object]()

#### Metrhord 2

```js
/**
 * The Type of events that can be specified as an `eventType` in the API calls.
 *
 * @typedef EVENT_TYPE
 * @type {Object}
 * @property {string} PLATFORM
 * @property {string} PROJECT
 * @property {string} THEMES
 */
const EVENT_TYPE = {
    PLATFORM: "platform",
    PROJECT: "project",
    THEMES: "themes"
};
```

Will Result in the following Markdown
> ## EVENT_TYPE
> The Type of events that can be specified as an `eventType` in the API calls.
>
> Type: [Object]()
>### Properties
>
>*   `PLATFORM` **[string]()**
>*   `PROJECT` **[string]()**
>*   `THEMES` **[string]()**


### 5. Function docs with `@function` or `method`

Use this to document a function and its arguments/returns/exceptions.

**Note that the `EVENT_TYPE` is autodetected and hyperlinked by the framework**

```js
/**
 * log a numeric count >=0
 *
 * @example <caption>To log that user clicked searchButton 5 times:</caption>
 * Metrics.countEvent(Metrics.EVENT_TYPE.UI, "searchButton", "click", 5);
 *
 * @param {EVENT_TYPE|string} eventType The kind of Event Type that needs to be logged- should be a js var compatible string.
 * Some standard event types are available as `EVENT_TYPE`.
 * @param {number} count >=0
 * @type {function}
 */
function countEvent(eventType, count) {}
```

Will Result in the following Markdown:

> ## countEvent
> log a numeric count >=0
> Type: [function][2]
>### Parameters
>*   `eventType` **([EVENT_TYPE]() | [string]())** The kind of Event Type that needs to be logged- should be a js var compatible string.
     Some standard event types are available as `EVENT_TYPE`.
>*   `count` **[number]()** > \=0
>### Examples
>To log that user clicked searchButton 5 times:
>```javascript
>Metrics.countEvent(Metrics.EVENT_TYPE.UI, 5);
>```
