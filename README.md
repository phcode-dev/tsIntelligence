# TypeScript Server (TSserver) Documentation Project

TSserver is a powerful tool that enhances TypeScript coding and project management. However, we recognize that the lack
of human-readable documentation can be a barrier to effectively utilizing its full potential. To address this challenge,
our project focuses on generating simple, accessible JSDoc documentation. Our goal is to make TSserver more
user-friendly, allowing anyone to leverage its capabilities without the need to decipher complex TypeScript code
syntaxes.

## Project Objective

Our main objective is to transform the complex and cryptic syntaxes of TSserver into easy-to-understand documentation.
We aim to provide clear, concise, and practical guides that cater to both beginners and experienced TypeScript
developers.

## Phoenix code LSP experiments

Please see `src/experiments/readme.md` for experiments and results for future LSP integration
into Phoenix Code.

## Getting Started

To get started with TSserver using our JSDoc documentation:

-   Open the `utils/server.js` file in your project.
-   View the JSDoc comments above each function to understand their usage and capabilities.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve and expand the documentation. If you have insights, examples, or enhancements,
